# 🚗 Car Price Prediction App

This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the market price of used cars based on key features such as make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and more. It also includes a Streamlit web application for interactive prediction.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Estimate used car prices accurately
- Provide a tool for dealerships and private sellers to evaluate car values
- Compare various machine learning models to select the best one
- Package everything into an intuitive Streamlit interface

## 🤖 Models Tested

The following regression models were trained and evaluated:
- 🔹 LinearRegression 
- 🔹 DecisionTreeRegressor 
- 🔹 GradientBoostingRegressor 
- 🔹 XGBoostRegressor  
- 🔹 LightGBMRegressor  
- 🔹 CatBoostRegressor 

### 📊 Metrics Used

| Model       		| MAE       | RMSE     |
|-------------------|-----------|----------|
| CatBoost    		| 1758.17   | 2968.08  |
| LightGBM    		| 1670.52   | 3039.68  |
| XGBoost     		| 1707.54   | 2935.52  |
| Linear Regression | 2077.56   | 4125.57  |
| Decision Tree 	| 2500.32   | 4419.97  |
| Gradient Boosting | 1725.61   | 3104.63  |

✅ **XGBoost (log-transformed target + tuning) was selected as the final model** with the lowest MAE **$1525.87** and RMSE **$2829.23**, aiming for the most consistent pricing across economy and mid-range cars.
